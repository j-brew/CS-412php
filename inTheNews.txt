	Jazz Corner celebrates 10th anniversary with benefit concerts

description:
	The concept of a jazz club on Hilton Head Island was a bit far-fetched when the Jazz Corner opened. The word was it wouldn't last. There was no way it could draw consistent acts. Even if it did, no one would want to pay the cover to get in. 
A decade later, the Jazz Corner has carved a niche in The Village at Wexford, defying projections of its demise. And, most recently, it's tried to foster the next generation of jazz lovers. 
In honor of its 10th anniversary, the Jazz Corner is holding a series of concerts to benefit its nonprofit foundation, Junior Jazz.
